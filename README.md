# PyBer Fare by City-Type Analysis

Project Overview
Create a visual data analysis that compares total fares over time. The total fare data is catagorized by the city-type (rural, urban, suburban) that the transaction took place.

Resources
* Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
* Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib

PyBer Analysis Results:
The analysis of the PyBer fare by city-type highlight the following differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:

When viewing the data trend from Figure 1:

* Urban cities far out-perform other city types in fare revenue.
* The fare-trends seem closely correlated in regards to the timeframe.
* Suburban cities seem to be excelerating in May, this could be due to school being out in the summer and would require further analysis

When viewing the data table from Figure 2:

There are more drivers than total rides for urban cities.
Both Rural and Suburban cities out perform Urban cities in average fare per driver
Average fare per ride data sugest that either urban cities charge a higher rate, or drive a lesser distance

PyBer Analysis Summary

The three business recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types are as follows:

Decrease the amount of Urban Drivers by placing limits on the time allowed between signing up as a driver and actually driving
Start advertising in Suburban cities during the lead-up to summer, where most families have more time to travel.
Keep Rural driver counts strong by incentivising, through advertising, the higher average fare per driver in rural cities.
Collect data on distance of ride, it could be that urban and suburban rides are significally longer, thus disincentivising rider count for these areas.
